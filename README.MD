I have updated the `readme.md` file based on your requirements. Here's the improved version:

```markdown
# SpaceX Launch Schedule

This project is a code test for Heidelberg Materials AG.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for running the API endpoint (optional)

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd project-directory
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```shell
npm start
```

5. The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to access the SpaceX Launch Schedule.

### API Endpoint Setup

1. Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

2. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.

3. Set the API endpoint as the startup project.

4. Start the application. It will run on `http://localhost:5000` or `https://localhost:5001` by default.

## Usage

The SpaceX Launch Schedule web application provides the following features:

- View past launches: Click on the "Past Launches" button to fetch and display the past SpaceX launches.

- View upcoming launches: Click on the "Upcoming Launches" button to fetch and display the upcoming SpaceX launches.

- View launch details: Click on the "Details" button for a specific launch to fetch and display additional details about that launch.

## Testing

Automated tests have been provided for the API endpoint using the MSTest framework. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

2. Open the Test Explorer window (`Test` > `Windows` > `Test Explorer`).

3. Click on the "Run All Tests" button in the Test Explorer window to execute all the tests.

## Difficulty and Timing

There were some difficulties in obtaining the API return results during runtime due to timing limitations. However, the application passes all the provided tests, showcasing the ability to code. If given more time, further improvements could have been made. Please note that I am currently working on other coding tests and need to adhere to my timing schedule.
